Activates Bitrise Remote Build Cache add-on for subsequent Gradle builds in the workflow

<summary>Description</summary>

This Step activates Bitrise's remote build cache add-on for subsequent Gradle executions in the workflow.

After this Step executes, Gradle builds will automatically read from the remote cache and push new entries if it's enabled.

## üß© Get started

Add this step directly to your workflow in the [Bitrise Workflow Editor](https://docs.bitrise.io/en/bitrise-ci/workflows-and-pipelines/steps/adding-steps-to-a-workflow.html).

You can also run this step directly with [Bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise).
